title: "Schema Manifest Format"
---

The `schema.toml` manifest declares package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. It must be placed at the root of your schema package.

## Basic Structure

```toml
[package]
name = "abc-corp"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Core types for ABC Corporation"
authors = [{ name = "alice", email = "alice@example.com" }]
homepage = "https://github.com/abc-corp/schemas"

[dependencies]
bar-corp = { path = "../bar-corp" }
common-types = { git = "https://github.com/abc-corp/common.git", ref = "v1.2.3" }
```

## Package Section

### `name`

Package name in **kebab-case** (e.g., `abc-corp`, `my-types`). Must be 2-128 characters, containing only lowercase letters, numbers\*, and hyphens.

\* numbers are only permitted after the first character

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Package names use **kebab-case** in manifests but **snake_case** in imports. The compiler handles this conversion automatically.
>
> ```kintsu
> # Manifest uses kebab-case
> name = "abc-corp"
>
> # Imports use snake_case
> use abc_corp::types;
> ```

### `version`

Semantic version following `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format (e.g., `1.2.3`).

### `description`

Human-readable package description. Can be inline text or a path to a file:

```toml
# Inline
description = "Core types for ABC Corporation"

# From file
description = { path = "README.md" }
```

### `authors`

List of package maintainers with optional email addresses:

```toml
authors = [
    { name = "Alice", email = "alice@example.com" },
    { name = "Bob" }
]
```

### `homepage`

Optional URL to project homepage or documentation.

## Dependencies

Dependencies are declared in the `[dependencies]` section using kebab-case names:

### Path Dependencies

Local filesystem paths (relative or absolute):

```toml
[dependencies]
bar-corp = { path = "../bar-corp" }
local-types = { path = "./vendor/types" }
```

> [!TIP]
> Use relative paths for path dependencies to keep your project portable across different machines and environments.

### Git Dependencies

Git repositories with tags or branches:

```toml
[dependencies]
common-types = { git = "https://github.com/org/common.git", tag = "v1.2.3" }
experimental = { git = "https://github.com/org/exp.git", branch = "main" }
```

### Registry Dependencies (Planned)

Remote registries with version constraints:

```toml
[dependencies]
std-types = { version = "^1.0.0", registry = "https://registry.example.com" }
```

## Versioning and Compatibility

> [!NOTE]
> Breaking change detection is planned but not yet implemented. The rules below describe the intended behavior.

### Semantic Versioning Rules

The compiler will enforce compatibility guarantees based on version changes:

#### **Patch Version** (`1.0.0` â†’ `1.0.1`)

- **Allowed**: documentation, internal refactoring
- **Not Allowed**: Any schema changes

Examples of valid patches:

- Documentation improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Internal implementation changes

#### **Minor Version** (`1.0.0` â†’ `1.1.0`)

- **Allowed**: Backward-compatible additions
- **Not Allowed**: Breaking changes

Examples of valid minor updates:

```kintsu
# YES - Adding optional fields
struct Message {
    id: i64,
    name: str,
    email?: str,  # New optional field
}

# YES - Adding new types
enum Status {
    Active = 1,
    Inactive = 2,
    Pending = 3,  # New variant
}

# YES - Adding new operations
operation CreateUser { ... }
operation UpdateUser { ... }  # New operation
```

#### **Major Version** (`1.0.0` â†’ `2.0.0`)

- **Allowed**: Any changes, including breaking changes

Examples requiring major version bump:

```kintsu
# NO - Removing fields
struct Message {
    id: i64,
    # name: str,  # REMOVED - breaking change
}

# NO - Changing field types
struct Message {
    id: str,  # Was i64 - breaking change
}

# NO - Making optional fields required
struct Message {
    id: i64,
    email: str,  # Was email?: str - breaking change
}

# NO - Removing enum variants
enum Status {
    Active = 1,
    # Inactive = 2,  # REMOVED - breaking change
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> Breaking changes require a major version bump. Consumers may need to update their code when upgrading across major versions.

### Version Constraints

Dependency version constraints will follow these patterns:

```toml
[dependencies]
# Exact version
lib-a = "1.2.3"

# Compatible updates (^)
# ^1.2.3 allows >= 1.2.3 and < 2.0.0
lib-b = "^1.2.3"

# Minor updates (~)
# ~1.2.3 allows >= 1.2.3 and < 1.3.0
lib-c = "~1.2.3"

# Range
lib-d = ">=1.2.3, <2.0.0"
```

## File Configuration

Control which schema files are included:

```toml
[files]
exclude = [
    "tests/**",
    "examples/**",
    "*.draft.ks"
]
```

## Complete Example

```toml
[package]
name = "abc-corp"
version = "1.2.3"
description = { path = "README.md" }
authors = [
    { name = "Alice Johnson", email = "alice@abc.com" },
    { name = "Bob Smith" }
]
homepage = "https://github.com/abc-corp/schemas"

[dependencies]
bar-corp = { path = "../bar-corp" }
common-types = { git = "https://github.com/org/common.git", tag = "v2.1.0" }

[files]
exclude = ["tests/**"]
```

## Validation

The manifest is validated on load:

- Package name must be valid kebab-case
- Version must be valid semantic version
- URLs must be well-formed
- Paths must exist (for path dependencies)
- All required fields must be present

Validation errors are reported with clear messages pointing to the specific issue.
